    "## Problem statement\n",
    "A key step in SLAM algorithms is to find the transform between two sets of observations $X_i$ and $X_j$, acquired at two different time instants $t_i$ and $t_j$, $t_j>t_i$. It is assumed that the environment of the robot is static. Hence, if a rigid transformation can be found that transforms the observation $X_j$ so that the observation correspond to $X_i$, then that rigid transform describes the rigid transform of the robot between the two times, from its pose at $t_i$ to its pose at $t_j$. \n",

    "In the rest of this notebook we are following the notation of the original publication on the ICP algorithm, [Besl and McKay (1992), A Method for Registration of 3_D Shapes IEEE Tr PAMI.](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs164-09-spring/Handouts/paper_icp.pdf). So, the set of observed points $P$ corresponds to the observation $X_j$, and the set of points $X$ corresponds to $X_i$. The ICP method will try to find a rigid transformation that best maps the points in $P$ to the points in $X$. See the example below, where the set $P_t$ is the transformed set.\n",
