    "# Pure pursuit\n",
    "A trajectory is provided in the form of a sequence of waypoints that the robot should pass (near) by on the way to the goal, which is the last waypoint in the sequence. The last step of the pure pursuit is approaching the goal point (last waypoint) using the go-to-goal behavior implemented for the robot. At some intermediate step in the trajectory following, we can illustrate the situation as in the figure below. The current waypoint is $p_k$ and the next waypoint is $p_{k+1}$. The intermediate goal point towards which the robot is to be steered, is a point on the trajectory which is at the distance $L$ from the robot. In the figure three different scenarios are depicted.\n",
